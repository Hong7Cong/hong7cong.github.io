I am currently PhD student majoring Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California `(USC)`. I am a member of Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory `(SAIL)` USC under co-supvervision of Dr. Michael Pazzani and Prof. Shrikanth Narayanan. Previously, I received Bachelor Degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology `(HUST)` supervised by Prof. Chuyen Nguyen Thanh.

Beyond technical expertise, I am also boardgame lover and hiker. Yet, I have only visited 4/63 National Parks in the US.
